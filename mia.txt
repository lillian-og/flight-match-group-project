My role is to be a Design specialist but also research and jump around.
 My responsiblities are to research about the company
and create an about me page with maya.
 I worked on getting my repo and making sure everything was up to date as well as know my
role in this project.
The biggest challenge was figuring out what everyone roles were gonna be and how to get all of us to be able to merge in the main branch.
My goal is to be able to communicate with my teammates and learn to work with each other.
I will work on the framework for the About me page as well as research with maya hopefully.

about us file at the same time.
A resource im using is just w3schools for some thing I might've forgotten to do.
A resource im using to collarborate better with my teammates is gmail chats.
