My role is project leader and main html coordinator. We were just trying to figure out all the git stuff today for the most part. Hopefully tomorrow I'm looking forward to 
working on actually getting some of the pages up and having a rough draft of the layout just to see where it's headed.
The biggest challenge today was trying to find somewhere to start and also figuring out all the git stuff. Working in a big group is hard, let alone figuring out 
how to navigate things I dont really understand with a group. My goals for my group are to hopefully work cohesively and have a smooth sailing 
working time and also having a fully functional website at the end of these next couple weeks.

What new challenge arose today ?
- I tried to use bootstrap to be able to style the front page now I just need to figure out how to get the local host to run. It wont for some reason. I keep getting
errors in my terminal.
