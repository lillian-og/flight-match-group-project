My of this project is front end. Im going to work on the CSS and HTML 
while also checking if everything is working right.
We worked talking over our parts, what we are better and not the good at. We also created our github branch for the project,
we made sure we were all in the same branch and got everyone up to speed.
The biggest challenge today was making sure I was in the right branch with no errors.
My goal for tommorrow is to get started on the About Me page but about our commpany with Mia.
Tommor we will talk about what should be needed in the page and how we should set it up.
